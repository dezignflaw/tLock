        <h3>Welcome to tLock.</h3>

<p>tLock is the most user-friendly locking program for tShock. With a nice, friendly, in-game gui, complete with buttons and a text box, you'll never confuse users with a "type /lockchest password 105cd" or any command, for that matter. With easy, built-in permissions and the option to change them (for more advanced users), tLock will secure your Terraria server, easily, the second it's installed.</p>

<p>Im pretty sure anyone bothering to look at this 
knows how to clone a fork... but for those who don't- 
type this into whatever program you use to run your git:</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/dezignflaw/tLock.git
</code></pre>

<p>We at tLock are happy to accomidate anyone who wants us to add support for your plugin. If you are the owner of a plugin and what support, please email me at: dezignflawmodding@gmail.com. Please include the link to your git. And, for those hiding away any private plugins: no, I won't give you support.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>I'd like to thank Steam, for introducing me to Terraria during their 2.50 sale;
And the tShock team: otherwise I'd be modding source.</p>

<h3>If you fix a bug or do something cool with this...</h3>

<p>Please let me know. The plugin gets better with every person who helps. And if you have an idea that you think should be incorperated: please, by all means, PM me (on steam or by email). Unless you want to make it yourself, of course.</p>
