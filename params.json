{"name":"tLock","tagline":"A locking plugin (chests, doors, signs, etc.) for tShock","body":"### Welcome to tLock.\r\ntLock is the most user-friendly locking program for tShock. With a nice, friendly, in-game gui, complete with buttons and a text box, you'll never confuse users with a \"type /lockchest password 105cd\" or any command, for that matter. With easy, built-in permissions and the option to change them (for more advanced users), tLock will secure your Terraria server, easily, the second it's installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIm pretty sure anyone bothering to look at this \r\nknows how to clone a fork... but for those who don't- \r\ntype this into whatever program you use to run your git:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/dezignflaw/tLock.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe at tLock are happy to accomidate anyone who wants us to add support for your plugin. If you are the owner of a plugin and what support, please email me at: dezignflawmodding@gmail.com . Please include the link to your git. And, for those hiding away any private plugins: no, I won't give you support.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\nI'd like to thank Steam, for introducing me to Terraria during their 2.50 sale;\r\nAnd the tShock team: otherwise I'd be modding source.\r\n\r\n### If you fix a bug or do something cool with this...\r\nPlease let me know. The plugin gets better with every person who helps. And if you have an idea that you think should be incorperated: please, by all means, PM me (on steam or by email). Unless you want to make it yourself, of course.\r\n\r\n### For More\r\nFor more tShock plugins, plus a bunch of other projects, check out my git at: @dezignflaw. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
