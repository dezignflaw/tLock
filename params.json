{"name":"tLock","tagline":"A locking plugin (chests, doors, signs, etc.) for tShock","body":"### Welcome to tLock.\r\ntLock is the most user-friendly locking program for tShock. With a nice, friendly, in-game gui, complete with buttons and a text box, you'll never confuse users with a \"type /lockchest password 105cd\" or any command, for that matter. With easy, built-in permissions and the option to change them (for more advanced users), tLock will secure your Terraria server, easily, the second it's installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIm pretty sure anyone bothering to look at this \r\nknows how to clone a fork... but for those who don't-\r\ntype this into whatever program you use to run your git:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/username/Spoon-Knife.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe at tLock are happy to accomidate anyone who wants us to add support for your plugin. If you are the owner of a plugin and what support, please email me at: dezignflawmodding@gmail.com. Please include the link to your git. And, for those hiding away any private plugins: no, I won't give you support.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
